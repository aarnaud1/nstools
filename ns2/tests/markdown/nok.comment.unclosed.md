In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly
used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying
on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used before final copy is available,
but it may also be used <!--to temporarily replace copy in a process called
greeking, which allows designers to consider form without the meaning of the
text influencing the design.
